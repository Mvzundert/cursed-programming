# First Annual Cursed Programming Event

## What is this?

Pretty simple. Submit a PR with the most terrible, horrible, atrocities you can think of committing in code.

## Some Ideas

- Vulkan but single line
- Code where every line is commented
- C compiler in JS and/or PHP
- Merging FE frameworks like React, Svelte, Vue, for no good reason
- Assembly code that runs malbolge
-  an entire program in C using only gotos for jumping? No functions except main (obviously stuff like std lib function calls would have to be allowed).
- borrow checker in rust
- some kind of transpiler that outputs filenames like js.c.h.bindings.c.js
- transpile zig code to rust written in go
- use db stored functions as backend exclusively
- sql to css transpiler
